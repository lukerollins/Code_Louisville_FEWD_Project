        <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
    
        <p>Since you already know my name I thought I'd tell you fine folks something about me. I'm mostly self taught as far as art goes. I had a photography class when I was in high school, I had a photographer as a mentor breifly after high school. Then I discover stenciling, especially then kind that involves aeorsol based paint. This lead me to learn to draw, in which I had a class at the Preston Arts on Bardstown Road (remember when there was one in New Albany?). I eventually I learned how comickers worked, which is what forced me to go digital. I've displayed my work at the Cindblock and I've made flyers for some local goth night type events. My biggest sponsors/patrons seem to be my family, especially my parents. </p>
